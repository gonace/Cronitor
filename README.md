# Cronitor Ping API Client
Cronitor is a service for heartbeat-style monitoring of anything that can send an HTTP request. It's particularly well suited for monitoring cron jobs, Jenkins jobs, or any other scheduled task.

This java library provides a simple abstraction for the pinging of a Cronitor monitor. For a better understanding of the API this library talks to, please see our Telemetry API docs.
